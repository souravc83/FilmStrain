FilmStrain
==========

Python library to analyze experimental images of the bending of cantilever and arches made of thin films.

Background
----------
Monitoring the shape of cantilevers and arches as they bend, and show buckling instabities, are useful in 
determining the strains and energy changes, and mechanical properties of these materials. This library was 
created to make quantitative analysis of experimental images. 

Installation
----------
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
    (same for windows, except ignore the sudo)
    
Usage
---------
A sample script for cantilever and beam is in the scripts folder. The movie containing the images
and the setvar.py file should be in the same folder as the script file.
